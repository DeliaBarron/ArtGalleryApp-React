### Promise.All( ) & Axios
In 2020, Axios updated their documentation reflecting that axios.all method has been deprecated and should be replaced with **Promise.all**
since this update, the proposal to get rid of both **axios.all** and **axios.spread** has been there.

#### Promise.all( )
Pomise.all method returns a ** single Promise** that fulfills when all of the iterable input's promises fulfill. 

###### parameters
 - **iterable:** array of promises
 ###### return values
- **Asynchronously fulfilled:** the fulfillment value is an array of fulfillment values in the order of the promises passed, regardless of completion order.
